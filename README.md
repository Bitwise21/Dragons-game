# Dragons-game
Kirito starts with strength **s** and must defeat **n** dragons. Each dragon has strength **xi** and grants **yi** bonus strength if defeated. Kirito can fight in any order. He wins a duel only if his current strength is strictly greater than the dragon’s strength; otherwise, he loses. Determine if he can defeat all dragons without losing once.
